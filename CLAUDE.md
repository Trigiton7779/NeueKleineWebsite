This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a simple static HTML website project containing a single HTML file (`index.html`). The project appears to be in German and serves as a minimal test page.

## Development Commands

Since this is a basic HTML project without a build system or package manager:
- Open `index.html` directly in a web browser to view the site
- No build, test, or lint commands are available
- Use any static file server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx serve .`) to serve the site locally

## Architecture

- **Static HTML**: Single-page website with basic HTML structure
- **No frameworks**: Pure HTML without JavaScript frameworks or CSS preprocessing
- **Minimal setup**: No dependencies or build tooling required
